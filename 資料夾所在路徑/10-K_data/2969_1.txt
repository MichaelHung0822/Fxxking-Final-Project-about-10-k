                  The Inline XBRL Viewer allows a user to quickly and
                  easily review details of the tagged information in an Inline
                  document by automatically placing a highlight border around
                  each tagged numeric fact and left-aligned border for each
                  block tagged fact. Hovering over a tagged fact will highlight
                  (shade) all content related to the tagged fact, and clicking
                  on a tagged fact will reveal its tagging details in the Fact
                  Review Window. Search and filter options are also provided to
                  easily refine and identify specific types of tagged
                  information.

                  The Fact Review Window shows the tagging details for
                  the currently selected fact, which is highlighted with a solid
                  blue background. There are four categories of fact detail
                  which can be viewed; an N/A value indicates
                  there is no available information for the item within the
                  given category:
                  
                    Attributes - All primary information (as
                      applicable) describing the tagged fact including period,
                      sign, decimals, dimensional detail (axes and members),
                      scale, measure, data type and footnotes
                    Labels - Detailed documentation
                      (definition) for the tag used, and other labels
                    References - Authoritative reference
                      information (as applicable) for the selected tag
                    Calculation - Balance and calculation
                      hierarchy details (numeric items only)
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                 Search 
              
              
                
                  
                    The Search box can be used to find tagged facts
                    matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag labels,
                    and tagged content are included in Search. To search tagged
                    information, enter a keyword and select the magnifying glass
                    icon to return matching results. Tagged facts matching the
                    search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default)
                    shading, while Tagged Sections are reduced to just those
                    that included the entered search keywords (if expanded; see
                    Tagged Sections for additional detail). The content included
                    in Search can be increased to included tag definitions,
                    dimensions, and authoritative references. See Settings for
                    more information.
                  
                  
                    Search operators and (via AND or
                    &) and or (via OR
                    or |) are available to further refine a
                    search. For example, and with Settings Include
                    References on, searching for FASB AND
                    225 will highlight tagged data that is related to
                    FASB Codification topic 225.
                  
                  
                    Filters can be used in conjunction with Search to
                    further refine the scope of Search. Filters reduce the
                    amount of tagged facts that the keyword search is performed
                    on. For example, if cash is entered in conjunction with a
                    Tags filter of Custom Only, the shaded search
                    results will only be indicated on tagged facts based on a
                    custom tag.

                    Filters change the number of highlighted facts
                    indicated by providing several ways to review the tagged
                    information. Multiple filters can be used at once. When the
                    first filter is applied, a filter toolbar indicates all
                    active filter selections and provides the ability to remove
                    one or all applied filters.

                  These filters options allow the user to refine the highlighted
                  tagged facts by data type:
                  
                    All - Displays all tagged data (default)
                    Amounts Only - Numeric items only
                    Text Only - Textual items only
                    Calculations Only - Numeric items
                      participating in a calculation
                    Negatives Only - Numeric items with the
                      Inline sign option
                    Additional Items Only - Tagged items
                      with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation (i.e.,

                  These filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts
                  by tag type:
                  
                    Standard Only - Tags from a common
                      taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, DEI)
                    Custom Only - Extension tags unique to
                      the entity's document
                  
                  More
                    Filters
                  Additional filters that allow user to further refine the
                  highlighted facts:
                  
                    Periods - List of all used context
                      reporting periods
                    Measures - List of all used units of
                      measure; as applicable
                    Axes - List of all used axes
                      (dimensions); as applicable
                    Scale - List of all used scaled options
                      (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable
                    Balance - Debit, credit; as applicable
                  
                  
                    Multiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For
                    example, selecting the "Amounts Only" Data filter and
                    "Custom Only" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged
                    facts using custom tags. Active filters are displayed in the
                    Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be
                    removed individually by selecting the "X" icon to the
                    right of each filter, or all at once via the "Clear All"
                    option.

                    Selecting the down arrow "V" to the right of the
                    facts count on the toolbar reveals the Facts Results
                      List; a navigable listing of all currently highlighted
                    tagged facts. By default, all tagged facts are displayed in
                    the Facts Results List. The list content and count
                    reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters
                    and Search criteria refine the list to match the
                    highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available
                    to move through the list as well as move the current view to
                    the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically.
                    When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it
                    will reveal the Fact Review Window.  If
                    the letter "A" appears for a fact, it indicates the
                    fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no
                    corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter "C"
                    appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter
                    "D" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional
                    information.

                    The Tagged Sections toolbar/menu item provides a
                    listing of the tagged sections of the Inline document. By
                    selecting a section item in the listing, the document will
                    navigate to that section. When the Tagged Sections feature
                    is open, the Search box will additionally filter the list of
                    sections to only those sections that match the entered
                    criteria.
